// if your game is currently CPU bound pushing the draw call limit due to the overhead required by OpenGL ES state validation, metal is the solution to move beyond that

// when a metal app is running from Xcode, the default scheme settings reduce performance
// Xcode detects whether the metal API is used in the source code and automatically enables the GPU Frame Capture and metal API validation settings
// when GPU Frame Capture is enabled, the debug layer is activated
// when Metal API Validation is enabled, each call is validated, which affects performance further
// for both settings, CPU performance is more affected than GPU performance
// unless you disable these settings, app performance may noticeably improve when the app is run outside of Xcode
// to disable, edit scheme -> run -> options
//  - gpu frame capture
//  - metal api validation
//  - enable user interface debugging

// 4 color attachments on A7, 8 color attachments for the A8
// it's possible to test for the GPU family using MTLFeatureSet:
//      A7 = MTLFeatureSet_iOS_GPUFamily1_v1
//      A8 = MTLFeatureSet_iOS_GPUFamily2_v1
// maximum MTLTextureDescriptor height and width is 4096

// the following objects are *not* transient
// reuse these objects in performance sensitive code, and avoid creating them repeatedly
//  - Command queues
//  - Data buffers
//  - Textures
//  - Sampler states
//  - Libraries
//  - Compute states
//  - Render pipeline states
//  - Depth/stencil states

// there are 2 ways to pass input to your vertex shader
// - pass a pointer to a struct, you declare, and then you use your vertex ID to index into it
//   which means you know the data layout of your vertex data in the shader
// - if you want to decouple it, use a vertex descriptor
//   the vertex descriptor tells metal how the vertices are laid out in memory
//   use a vertex descriptor for interleaved data
